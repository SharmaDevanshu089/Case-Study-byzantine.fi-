 - 24/7 liquidity: Assets are always accessible
 - Safety and compliance: Strategy curated by Keyrock, a regulated EU & US Digital Asset Service  Provider, under full AML, KYC, MiCA, and SOC 2 Type II frameworks.

 - Active risk monitoring: Continuous rebalancing and diversification to preserve capital.
